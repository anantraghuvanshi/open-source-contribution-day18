# open-source-contribution-day18</br>
This is the 18th day since I started but I must admit that I have slowed down a bit because of some family problems.</br>
I am still stuck at the same advanced react course where I am learning about hooks, states and redux.</br>
I am hoping that I can continue my studies and come back to my regular routine soon.
